        amount of information on the internet. Search Engine Dominance: Google
        quickly became the most popular search engine due to its superior search
        algorithms and clean user interface. It officially became a company in
        1998. IPO (2004): Google went public with its Initial Public Offering in
        2004, raising significant capital and becoming a publicly-traded
        company. Diverse Product Portfolio: Google expanded its product range to
        include Gmail (2004), Google Maps (2005), and Google Earth (2005). It
